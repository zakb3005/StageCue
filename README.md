# StageCue

**StageCue** is a collaborative storytelling application inspired by *Sleep is Death*. One player hosts a session as the Director, while others join as Actors to interact with scenes in real time.

Everything in this application was built from scratch using MonoGame for rendering and Fleck for real-time WebSocket communication. It features a fully custom scene editor, asset manager, and turn-based interaction system where a designated Director controls the scene while multiple Actors can move props, write dialog, and interact in real time. Custom objects and stages (backgrounds) can be added via the StageCue folder generated by the program in the user's documents. Scenes can be saved and loaded as JSON files from the in-game object browser, with automatic screenshot thumbnails generated for quick visual reference. The entire interface and logic were custom-coded to provide a smooth, minimalist, one-of-a-kind collaborative storytelling experience.

## How to Use

1. **Build the project** using Visual Studio or `dotnet build`.
2. **Run the app.** On first launch, it will create a `StageCue` folder in your `Documents` with starter assets.
3. From the main menu, choose **Host** (requires port forwarding) or **Join** using the host's IP and port.
4. Take turns building scenes together with props, stages, dialog bubbles, and action prompts.

## How to Add Custom Assets

- After your first time hosting or joining a scene, a `StageCue` folder is generated in your PC's `Documents` folder with some starter assets.
- .png files can be put into the `Objects/Stages` folders, or any sub-folders created within them as well.
- These files will be loaded by the app when hosting or joining a server, and can be accessed from the in-app object browser (as the `director`).

### Note:
- The dimensions of the image will be scaled depending on the size of the background (e.g. A 5x5 px object will be extremely small in a 1920x1080 px stage, whereas the same 5x5px object will be quite large in a 10x10 px stage).
- In order for other users to be able to use the same asset within a session, they `must have the same file in the same folder pathway`.
