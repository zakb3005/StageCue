# StageCue

**StageCue** is a collaborative storytelling application inspired by *Sleep is Death*. One player hosts a session as the Director, while others join as Actors to interact with scenes in real time.

## How to Use

1. **Build the project** using Visual Studio or `dotnet build`.
2. **Run the app.** On first launch, it will create a `StageCue` folder in your `Documents` with starter assets.
3. From the main menu, choose **Host** (requires port forwarding) or **Join** using the host's IP and port with port forwarding.
4. Take turns building scenes together with props, stages, dialog bubbles, and action prompts.

## Notes

- The Director can insert props, change stages, and assign object ownership.
- Actors can control owned objects, write speech bubbles, and submit action prompts.
